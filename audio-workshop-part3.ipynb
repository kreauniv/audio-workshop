    "In this part, we consider the inverse problem of what we've been dealing with so far -- given a digitized audio signal that is known to be a sine wave at some particular constant frequency, our task is to find out what that frequency is. The approach we'll take here is not one of mathematical rigour, but by working our way up gaining an experimental understanding of the issues.\n",

We left a phase value $\\phi$ in there to capture the fact that we won't know the phase of the given sine wave and will have to account for that. Note that if we average over an exact number of periods, we get 0 obviously."

    "As we increase T, we can see that the numerator stays within the range $[0,2]$ whereas the denominator increases monotonically. Therefore as T increases in such a manner that $2\\pi f T \\gg 1$, the above expression for the average drops down to $0$. That inequality can be seen to mean \"we should average over a sufficient number of periods of the sine wave\". Note that if $T$ where such that $fT$ is an integer, then the integral would be exactly $0$ irrespective of $\\phi$."

This function is pretty flat around $\\delta fT \\approx 0$, which suggests that it is not useful to pick an arbitrarily small value for $\\delta f$ to test since we won't be able to tell much of the difference between $\\delta f$ and say $2\\delta f$, especially since real world signals won't be pure sine waves. This holds mostly up to about $\\delta fT \\approx 1/4$. So if we choose a $\\delta f$ that's too small, we'll anyway have difficulty telling which of the various $k\\delta f$ for integer $k$ we should take as the peak. It doesn't help therefore to pick a $\\delta f$ that's less than about $1/{4T}$. This further means that if we want a frequency measurement that's accurate to $\\delta f$, then we should average over a sufficiently long period of time determined by $T \\approx 1/\\delta f$. Note that this means we don't know the time at which the signal takes on the found frequency within an interval of span $T$. So you can only find out one of the two - frequency or time - to arbitrary precision. This is the \"frequency - time uncertainty principle\" in action."

    "\n",
    "The signal expression $s(t)$ is known in literature as a **time domain representation** and its corresponding function $S(f)$ is called its **frequency domain representation** or the **spectrum** or the **Fourier transform** of $s(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, just knowing that we can think in terms of these two representations will suffice and we'll work through some of these aspects as we go along in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A couple of important interesting facts about the spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting aspect worth pointing out is that if we time stretch the time domain signal $s(t)$ to be $s(\\alpha t)$, then its \"spectrum\" gets shrunk by $\\alpha$ - i.e. the spectrum of $s(\\alpha t)$ is $S(f/\\alpha)$. Similarly, if we shrink $s(t)$, its spectrum gets stretched by the same factor. You can use this result to see why you cannot measure both the precise frequency of a pure tone signal *and* the precise time at which it occurs (when it is time limited) -- because if you shrink the time extent of the signal, the spectrum gets more spread out and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly if we time shift $s(t)$ to $s(t-t_0)$, then the spectrum gets multiplied by a complex phase -- i.e. the spectrum of $s(t-t_0)$ is $e^{-2\\pi ift_0}S(f)$. This also holds in reverse - i.e. if you \"frequency shift\" $S(f)$ to $S(f-f_0)$, the corresponding time domain signal becomes modulated by a cos-sin wave $e^{2\\pi if_0t}s(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you consider $f(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}{e^{2\\pi ift}F(f)df}$, it is easy to see how $$f'(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}{(2\\pi if)e^{2\\pi ift}F(f)df}$$ -- i.e. the Fourier transform of $f'(t)$ is simply $F(f)$ multiplied by $2\\pi if$. This property makes the Fourier transform (and the related \"Laplace Transform\") very useful in solving linear differential equations."
