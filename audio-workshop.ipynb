    "This notebook is intended to walk a beginner through basic concepts of audio signal processing required to get into audio synthesis and analysis. A basic familiarity with the Julia programming language is required. A number of tutorials are available at [Julia Tutorials](https://julialang.org/learning/tutorials/). For the basics, you may want to refer to the [Julia Language - a concise tutorial](https://syl1.gitbook.io/julia-language-a-concise-tutorial/)."

    "## Basic concepts and terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "A digital audio signal is represented as a sequence of numbers taken to refer to some physical aspect of the sound such as air pressure around a microphone over time. The pressure is an analog quantity - i.e. can be measured at any given time and not only at specific times. Since we cannot deal with real world analog quantities on a computer, we use an approximation of it by **sampling** the analog quantity at regular intervals of time, called the **sampling rate** (in \"Hertz\" Hz - which is \"samples per second\"), and digitizing the pressure value into a number, usually in the range `[-1.0 to 1.0]`. For our purposes, we'll use 32-bit floating point numbers to represent these \"samples\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **stereo** audio signal -- an audio signal with two **channels** -- each sample will be made of two such numbers, one for the left pickup and one for the right pickup. A pair of such samples may be referred to in the literature as a **sample frame**, a **frame** or just as a **sample** if the context is clear. For more complex signals like 8-channel surround sound, similarly 8 different numbers are packed into a **sample frame**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For our purpose, we'll mostly be dealing with **mono** sound signals - i.e. which have only one **channel**. A mono signal therefore has a very simple representation when working with the sound - a simple one-dimensional `Float32` array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common \"sampling rates\" used in audio processing are 22.05KHz, 44.1KHz, 48KHz and 96KHz (where KHz = \"Kilo Hertz\" where 1KHz = 1000Hz). **We will use 48KHz unless otherwise noted**. This is a good quality sampling rate and is usually the default on today's desktop computers and operating systems."

    "## A note on volume levels\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, we noted that sound signals are \"digitized\" into numbers in the range `[-1.0 to 1.0]`. The maximum value of a sample can therefore be `1.0`. However, we do not want to use the full range since a computer's audio system may treat this as a very loud sound at default volume settings. Furthermore, we will need some \"head room\" when we're working with audio signals by combining multiple signals or running algorithms on them. For example, if we add two sine waves of **amplitude** 1.0 each, we'll get an amplitude of 2.0, which exceeds the range. When the range is exceeded and you play the audio anyway, you will hear what is called **clipping** - where the audio system on your computer will take `min(max(signal, -1.0), 1.0)` and play the result. **We do not want our audio to clip**. So either we will process the audio to reduce the amplitude after applying any processing steps, or we will simply use lower amplitude values to start with."

    "## Making a sine tone\n",
    "\n",
    "A pure tone has the shape of the mathematical `sin(x)` function. The formula for such a pure sine tone can therefore be expressed as - $y(t) = a * \\text{sin}(2\\pi ft)$, where $a$ is the \"amplitude\" of the sine wave -- i.e. the maximum value it can take on, and $f$ is the frequency in Hz. $t$ is the time in seconds. This is the mathematical formula for an analog audio signal. In order to \"digitize\" it, we will convert it into a discrete series by calculating values at discrete times given by $t = f_s i$ where $f_s$ is the **sampling rate** (also known as **sampling frequency**) in some literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us make a 10-second long sine tone which has a frequency of 440Hz (the pitch known as \"A440\") and try to play it back."
