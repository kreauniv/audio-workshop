    "# Relationship between \"frequency\" and \"phase\" contd.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw how the simple \"sine wave\" can be represented using the mathematical function $y(t) = a \\text{sin}(2\\pi f t)$ where we said that $f$ is the \"frequency\" of the sine wave. Well, if you completed the last task in the first workshop notebook, you might've guessed that that was a lie ... sort of.\n",
    "\n",
    "The part within the $\\text{sin}(...)$ expression is called the **phase**, often denoted using the symbol $\\phi$. As the value of the function evolves over time, the phase goes up linearly with time - since it is $\\phi(t) = 2\\pi{}ft$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to understand the relationship between phase and frequency deeper if we want to understand how to deal with pure tones whose perceived frequency itself changes over time. If we naively try to substitute the constant $f$ with a function of $t$ like for example $f(t) = 400 if t < 5 else 800$, we can clearly see that we'll encounter a discontinuity in the phase at $t = 5$, which will cause a discontinuity in the value of the sine wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what's wrong with having a discontinuity in the audio signal? If you'd noticed either by listening or looking at the waveform, you'd have heard \"clicks\" whenever there is a discontinuity in the audio waveform. These \"clicks\" only get worse when we start considering more complicated frequency functions of time like what with music."

    "\n",
    "The part of the sine wave expression $\\int_0^t{f(\\tau)d\\tau}$ is a useful component to describe quasi periodic signals whose \"frequency\" keeps changing from time to time. We'll call this function the \"phasor\" - i.e. $\\text{phasor}(t) = \\int_0^t{f(\\tau)d\\tau}$. We can now express the sine wave (and other waves too) as $\\text{sine_wave}(t) = a(t) \\text{sin}(2\\pi \\text{phasor}(t))$. Note that the wave completes a period every time $\\text{phasor}(t)$ crosses an integer."

    "\n",
    "If you noticed, we can no longer use the same approach to writing julia functions for these waves that we did at first. This is because to calculate the signal at any given time $t$, we will have to calculate an integral from the start of tiume $0$ to time $t$ ... which would be an expensive operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our `digitize` function calculates the signal value for incremental time steps, it would be adequate if we model our functions to also work in time increments of $T$ where $T$ is the time between two audio samples - i.e. \"the sampling interval\" -- where $f_s = 1/T$ gives the \"sampling frequency\" a.k.a. \"sampling rate\". Our mathematical function therefore has to now become \"stateful\" since we need to keep track of the \"current phase\" from one time step to the next."
