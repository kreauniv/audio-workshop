    "# Part 2b: Modulated signals\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have an understanding of the relationship between the \"phase\" of a periodic signal, which acts like a timer for indexing into a single period of the signal, and its \"frequency\". We also understand how we can make the frequency change from moment to moment by making the phase go faster or slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modulation** is the term used to describe a modification of a signal by addition or multiplication with another signal. Though you can generalize beyond those operations, we'll restrict our exploration to that as they're very common and useful in synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Amplitude modulation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the simplest of the various kinds of modulated signals we can produce. Given a signal $s(t)$, we can \"modulate\" it with another \"amplitude signal\" $a(t)$ using multiplication to get $a(t)s(t)$. While this is a general way to state modulation, typically, $s(t)$ is taken to be a quasi periodic signal with some \"nice\" frequencies in it and $a(t)$ is a signal that moves slowly relative to the period of $s(t)$ - i.e. it changes relatively little over a single period of $s(t)$ ... though that isn't a strict requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this kind of modulation, we can produce interesting mised signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we consider modulating a sine wave with a given frequency by another sine wave of relatively very low frequency - i.e. $\\sin(2\\pi \\delta ft)\\sin(2\\pi ft)$ where we use $\\delta f$ to denote a small frequency, we can apply some basic trigonometry to see that this expression can be rewritten as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sin(2\\pi \\delta ft)\\sin(2\\pi ft) = (1/2)(\\cos(2\\pi(f-\\delta f)t) - \\cos(2\\pi(f+\\delta f)t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "since we know that $$\\cos(a+b) = \\cos(a)\\cos(b) - \\sin(a)\\sin(b)$$ and so $$ \\sin(a)\\sin(b) = (1/2)(\\cos(a-b) - \\cos(a+b))$$."

    "How do we interpret the above equation?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now see that modulating the amplitude of a sine wave using another low frequency sine wave will result in two sine waves of slightly different frequencies being \"mixed\" - i.e. added ... and vice versa - i.e. the mixing of two sine waves with close frequencies will sound like a single sine wave that's being modulated by a slow oscillating ampltidue where the oscillation frequency is half of the difference between the two frequencies being mixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the frequency of the modulating signal becomes higher, the separation between the two mixed frequencies also increases. If the separation is comparable to the frequency of the sine wave being modulated, then you'll hear two distinct tones whereas if the separation is relatively small, you'll hear it as a \"wobble\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Synthesize such a modulated signal, listen to it and observe what it sounds like for different values of the modulating signal's frequencies."

    "\n",
    "We also saw how when we perceive frequency as \"pitch\", we perceive relative ratios of frequencies to be qualitatively the same. This gave us the \"octave\" and the 12 tones within the octave. Supposing we want to modulate the frequency of the sine wave to make a melody, what we'd want to do is to think in terms of the tone changes and not frequency changes. Since pitch behaves as $\\log_2(f)$, we can take our modulation signal $m(t)$ and apply it to a base frequency as shown below -\n",

    "\n",
    "We can directly modulate the phase in analogous ways. However, phase is not something we directly perceive as a quality of a sound. We can't tell the difference between a sine wave or a cosine wave. However, our auditory system can use phase differences between signals arriving at our ears in order to locate a sound source. Therefore phase modulation is useful when you wish to mimic sound sources being placed in 3D and we're producing stereo sound.\n",
